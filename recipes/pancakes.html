        Whether breakfast or brunch, blueberry pancakes will be a hit and have everyone ready to be the early bird to get the pancake.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dry ingredients can be mixed the night before to make prep time easier and a bit quicker come morning. I don't know about you, but for me, measuring early in the morning pre-coffee or tea can sometimes be a challenge, so any prep ahead of time is good with me. Fresh or frozen blueberries will work for this pancake recipe. If using frozen, let them thaw before adding them to the batter. If needed, strain excess water too.
